                            <p>
                                Worked with building SEO-blogs using Wordpress (GeneratePress theme), which gave a lot of HTML and CSS practice. At the Projects page you can find some examples of the work I did. Also learned several new things required to do the job, such as Ext.js, PHP and JQuery. I used these languages to create a stand alone system built on an open source backend, where you could log in, register, reset password by email and once you logged in you could see syncronous changes of your GPS devices and other attributes, all written in JQuery and modern JavaScript.

                                Big focus on proper unit testing with JUnit test. Also learned about RESTful API, Frontend related languages, tools and relational databases using SQL Workbench.
                                Used Spring boot to create RESTful APIs and full stack applications.
